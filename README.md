# network-intrusion-detector
This project is an AI-based network Intrusion Detection System (IDS), a convolutional neural network model trained to distinguish between intrusions/attacks and normal connections.

The model is trained by generalizing the KDD Cup 1999 dataset. [See full project report.](https://saechaol.com/images/pdf/ml_nid_report.pdf)
