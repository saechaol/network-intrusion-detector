# network-intrusion-detector
The following project is software aimed to detect network intrusions to a computer network from unauthorized users, including the possibility of insiders. This project then aims to build an AI-based network Intrusion Detection System (IDS), a predictive model to distinguish between intrusions/attacks and normal connections.

The model is trained by generalizign the KDD Cup 1999 dataset.
